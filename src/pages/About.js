            Hi, I'm Meet, a full-stack developer with a passion for technology
            that knows no bounds. My journey into the world of coding began when
            I was just a 10th standard student, fascinated by the magic of
            Google Maps. Little did I know that this curiosity would spark a
            chain reaction, leading me to pursue a career in engineering and
            eventually, coding. As I delved deeper into the world of technology,
            I found inspiration in the likes of Tony Stark, aka Iron Man, and
            his incredible suits. This fascination with innovation and
            problem-solving drove me to choose electronic engineering as my
            path. However, it was coding that ultimately won my heart, and I've
            been hooked ever since.
